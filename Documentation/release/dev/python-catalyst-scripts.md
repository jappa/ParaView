## Improved Python-based Catalyst pipeline scripts

We have completely refactored the Python scripts intended for in situ with Catalyst. While the
older forms of the Catalyst Python scripts are still supported, the new version supports
several new capabilities that make it easier to develop and debug. The ParaView GUI now exports
only these newer Catalyst Python scripts. Some of the highlights include, ability to use zipped
archives, consistency with ParaView batch scripts, ability to launch Catalyst scripts with pvbatch.
