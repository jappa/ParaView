## Overlapping Dells Detector filter

`Overlapping Cells Detector` is a new filter that exposes the cells overlapping
other cells inside the same input. The output of this filter features the cell
data array `NumberOfCollisionsPerCell`, which counts the number of cells
overlapping the corresponding cell.
