# Redo command keyboard shortcut changed from Ctrl-R to Ctrl-Y

Ctrl-Y (or Command-Y on macOS) is a common keyboard shortcut for the redo command in many applications, so we have made it the same in ParaView. In addition, we added a keyboard shortcut for the Reset Session command to the Edit menu entry.
