# Improve Time Display and Time Selection

* This add a new 'Time Notation' setting (scientific, fixed or mixed).
  Time display is automatically updated when settings (precision or notation) change.
  In 'Snap to timesteps' mode, the available times are selectable from a combobox,
  so going to a specific time is easier and faster.
