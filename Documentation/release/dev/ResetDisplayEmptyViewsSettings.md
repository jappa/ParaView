* Add a "Reset Display Empty View" Setting

Available in Edit->Settings->General->Misc, this settings
control whether or not to reset the display (hence moving the camera so data is visible)
when showing a representation in an empty view.

Previously ParaView always showed this behavior and the default settings keep it this way,
but it is now possible to disable it when needed.
