# Support of TrueType font files

It is now possible display 2D/3D text with user provided TrueType font files,
and thus use different fonts than the built-in ones (Arial, Courier & Times).
This feature is accessible by choosing `FontFile` as font family in the GUI
and then specify the full path to the `.ttf` file in the font file path field.
