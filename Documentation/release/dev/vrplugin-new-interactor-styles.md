# VRPlugin new interactor styles

Two new interactor styles have been added to the VR plugin:
- `Stylus`: Use the position of the stylus to apply translation and rotation to the camera.
- `Move point`: Use a tracker to move intuitively a 3D point in camera space.

Both are well suited for some devices which take benefit from a stylus like the zSpace.
