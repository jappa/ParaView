Changes to pqPresetDialog

The pqPresetDialog now has 16 default color maps and an advanced button to show the full list.  This is to avoid overwhelming users with the full list of color maps and to encourage use of color maps that are good for perception rather that just using Rainbow for everything.  Users can also promote color maps to show in the default view below the default color maps.
