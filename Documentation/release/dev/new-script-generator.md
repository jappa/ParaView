# New Catalyst Script Definition and Export

There is a new streamlined process for defining and exporting
Catalyst scripts. The Catalyst Export Inspector panel is the new
place to define everything you want Catalyst to eventually export.
Your choices are saveable in ParaView State files and match the
normal UI for exporting data files and screenshots. There are some
new options too, including choices to export Cinema Spec D tables
and to place all Catalyst output inside a specific directory. To
export the Catalyst Script you've defined, use the new Export
Catalyst Script option.

Both entry points are under the Catalyst menu. The original
Export State wizard and Data Extract Writers controls are still
there too but they are deprecated and will be removed soon.
