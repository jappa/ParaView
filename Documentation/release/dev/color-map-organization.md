## Color map groups

Color maps have been organized into groups based on their type. The groups are:

* Linear - color maps that vary with approximate perceptual linearity from one end to the other
* Diverging - color maps that vary w
* Rainbow
* Isoluminant
* Structured

The previously available groups "Default" (recommended) and "All" are still available and remain unchanged.

Some redundant color maps have been removed, including:

* "coolwarm" - use "Cool to Warm" instead
* "CIELab_blue2red" - use "CIELab Blue to Red" instead
* "gray_Matlab" - use "Grayscale" instead
* "rainbow" - use "Blue to Red Rainbow" instead
* "Red to Blue Rainbow" - use "Blue to Red Rainbow" instead and reverse it
