# Preset for chart series colors

Adds the ability to use presets for series color in charts.
Previously, series colors could only be modified manually, one after the
others. The preset mechanism used in the ColorMap editor (with categorical colors)
is now available for plot series. Presets can be applied, modified and saved.
Optionally, legends can also be saved and loaded.

When loading a preset, colors and legend are set corresponding to the series name
when possible.
