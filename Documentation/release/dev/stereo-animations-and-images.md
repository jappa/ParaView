## Save left and right eye images and animations in one go

**Save Animation Options** and **Save Screenshot Options** now support a
stereo mode called **Both Eyes**. When chosen, ParaView will save images (or
videos) for the left and right eye. The left-eye output files are suffixed with
`_left` while the ones for the right-eye are suffixed with `_right`.
